# Jim's Peaceful Little Practice Repo 
## **I'm LEARNING HERE!** 🧑‍🎓
Cut me some slack here!

---
- This repo is more to practice git than anything and get my brain bigger and stuff. The code in here is mostly notes and labs and stuff from [freeCodeCamp][https://www.freecodecamp.org]'s Full Stack curriculum along with other stuff I find so I can type it with my fingees and have it as handy reference and whatnot.
- I may have a few things I've coded off da toppa my dome in the my-projects directory, and you can feel free to call me names based on whatever you find in there but remember that I am just a child and I'll cry. 👶

Anyways, I love you, and thanks in advance for treating me with kindness as I am in fact a defenseless child. Would an adult be teaching himself JavaScript? I thought not. Don't worry, as I age and lose hope I'll pick up C++ or Java and start tucking my shirt into pleated slacks and I'll be a real computer expert like you guys

I need to get Claude to start making these for me again so I can get more emojis
